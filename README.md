The project aims to analyze electric vehicle types and their characteristics to provide insights into factors influencing consumer choices between battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). By examining factors such as electric range, base MSRP, and consumer preferences, stakeholders in the electric vehicle industry can develop effective marketing strategies, design innovative products, and inform public policy. Consumers can also benefit from this analysis by making more informed decisions when purchasing an electric vehicle that best meets their individual needs and preferences. Overall, this analysis seeks to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create a more sustainable transportation system for the future.
